=Introduction=

LDA-frames is an approach to identifying semantic frames from semantically unlabelled text corpora. 
There are many frame formalisms but most of them suffer from the problem that all the frames must 
be created manually and the set of semantic roles must be predefined. The LDA-Frames approach, 
based on the Latent Dirichlet Allocation, avoids both these problems by employing statistics on 
a syntactically tagged corpus. The only information that must be given is a number of semantic 
frames and a number of semantic roles to be identified. This limitation, however, can be avoided 
by automatic estimation of both these parameters. The model which is able to estimate the number 
of frames and roles automatically is called Non-parametric LDA-Frames.

=Dependencies=
    Python >= 2.5
    Java 6 >= JDK 1.6 (Only when using the Stanford parser for generating the syntactic dependencies.)
    g++ >= 4.6
    Boost program options development package >= 1.46
    GNU Scientific Library (GSL) development package >= 1.15
    OpenMP (Only when using the multithreaded sampler)
    

=Bulding binaries from the source codes on Ubuntu 13.10.=

#Install necessary dependencies.
$ sudo apt-get install g++ libboost-program-options-dev libgsl0-dev

#Move into the working directory of the sampler.
$ cd sampler

# Build the binary file.
$ make

=Input and Output Data=

The input data for the sampler must have the form of a text file where each line corresponds to one 
lexical unit. Each line consists of tabulator-separated corpus realizations, where each realization 
is composed of space-separated positive integers that represent word identifiers for all slots. The 
number 0 is reserved for an empty slot. An example of the input file for 3 lexical units with 
two-slot realizations is shown below. 

1 2	3 4	2 3
4 2	1 3	3 2	3 2
4 4	3 4	4 0

In order to be able to interpret the result, a dictionary that translates the line numbers into lexical 
units and word identifiers into words is required. The dictionary along with the sampler input file can 
be generated using the _generate-samplerinput.py_ script. As its input, it takes a text file where each 
line consists of a lexical unit and tabulator-separated realization from a corpus. The first line must 
start with ';', and consists of tabulator-separated names of used grammatical relations. For example:

;SUBJECT	OBJECT
eat	people	cake
eat	man	bread
cook	woman	cake

The result produced by the sampler comprises two files -- "frames.smpl", which contains frame identifiers 
corresponding to the realization positions in the input file, and "roles.smpl", which contains as many 
rows as and the number of frames, and as many columns as the number of slots. The numbers there represent 
semantic role identifiers.
